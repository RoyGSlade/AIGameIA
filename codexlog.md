1. Fixed 404 errors by updating index.html to use absolute paths for game assets.
2. Updated server paths to be absolute using __dirname for reliable asset loading.
3. Added base href tag and absolute iframe path to ensure asset loading after moving index.html to /public.
4. Verified server serves CSS and JS with correct MIME types after the move and confirmed all tests pass.

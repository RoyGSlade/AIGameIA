1. Fixed 404 errors by updating index.html to use absolute paths for game assets.
2. Updated server paths to be absolute using __dirname for reliable asset loading.
3. Added base href tag and absolute iframe path to ensure asset loading after moving index.html to /public.
4. Verified server serves CSS and JS with correct MIME types after the move and confirmed all tests pass.

5. Updated server static path to /public/Game and fixed test imports after moving files. All tests pass.
6. Verified character creation HTML references local assets correctly and ensured tests pass.
7. Updated characterCreationUI.js to fetch JSON data from /Game/data with a helper function for error logging. All tests pass.
8. Added endpoint to serve schema.json from server and updated saveManager.js to load it correctly in browser and tests. Tests remain green.
9. Reordered server middleware so schema.json is served before static routing to fix 404 errors.
10. Pointed server and scripts to schema.json under /public/Game/data/schema. Updated saveManager and its test, fixed character creation JSON paths, removed unused node-fetch dependency and deleted empty creation.js. All tests pass.
11. Documented current file structure in SYSTEM_SPEC and filled in last update date. All tests still pass.
12. Created dataUtils module to resolve character creation data paths and updated characterCreationUI.js to use it. Added test for path resolution.


13. Fixed character creation data paths by using a constant base URL in dataUtils to avoid incorrect imports. All tests pass.

14. Added extensive console logging for each step and selection in characterCreation and UI modules to help debug persona loading and selection progress. All tests pass.

1. Fixed 404 errors by updating index.html to use absolute paths for game assets.
2. Updated server paths to be absolute using __dirname for reliable asset loading.
3. Added base href tag and absolute iframe path to ensure asset loading after moving index.html to /public.
4. Verified server serves CSS and JS with correct MIME types after the move and confirmed all tests pass.
5. Updated server static path to /public/Game and fixed test imports after moving files. All tests pass.
6. Verified character creation HTML references local assets correctly and ensured tests pass.
7. Updated characterCreationUI.js to fetch JSON data from /Game/data with a helper function for error logging. All tests pass.
8. Added endpoint to serve schema.json from server and updated saveManager.js to load it correctly in browser and tests. Tests remain green.
9. Reordered server middleware so schema.json is served before static routing to fix 404 errors.
10. Pointed server and scripts to schema.json under /public/Game/data/schema. Updated saveManager and its test, fixed character creation JSON paths, removed unused node-fetch dependency and deleted empty creation.js. All tests pass.
11. Documented current file structure in SYSTEM_SPEC and filled in last update date. All tests still pass.
12. Created dataUtils module to resolve character creation data paths and updated characterCreationUI.js to use it. Added test for path resolution.
13. Fixed character creation data paths by using a constant base URL in dataUtils to avoid incorrect imports. All tests pass.
14. Added extensive console logging for each step and selection in characterCreation and UI modules to help debug persona loading and selection progress. All tests pass.
15. Updated dataUtils to return a relative path when loaded from the filesystem so character creation JSON loads correctly without a web server. Adjusted tests to match. All tests pass.
16. Reworked dataUtils to resolve paths relative to the script and added a JSON import fallback for file:// pages. Updated tests for new path logic.
17. Improved JSON import fallback in dataUtils to work with both "with" and "assert" syntaxes so persona presets load in newer Node versions. All tests pass.
18. Added README with instructions to start the server before loading game pages and inserted a file:// warning script in character-creation.html.
19. Renamed character creation data folder to `character-creation` to avoid URL encoding issues. Updated dataUtils path, tests, and SYSTEM_SPEC. All tests pass.
20. Added missing data detection in characterCreationUI with modal error display using new uiUtils module. Created uiUtils.test for isDataLoaded. Updated CSS with error modal styles and README troubleshooting tips.
21. Replaced abbreviated variable names in dataUtils and saveManager for clarity. All tests pass.
22. Added server verification section in README with instructions to check browser console and network logs for missing JSON files.
23. Added fetchJsonFile.test.js to verify dynamic import fallback when fetch fails, using node:test framework. All tests pass.


24. Inserted base href tag in character-creation.html and updated CSS and script paths to absolute /Game references. Verified links load and all tests pass.


24. Made server port configurable via PORT env variable and updated README with instructions about overriding the default port.

24. Created personaPresets.test.js to verify persona presets JSON loads with presetPersonas array.


24. Added null checks after each fetchJsonFile call in characterCreationUI with a helper that logs missing file paths and updates the modal via showDataLoadError. Modified showDataLoadError to accept a file path so the message identifies the failed load. All tests pass.

25. Revised dataUtils to build root-relative paths so fetch works on Express server. Updated fetchJsonFile fallback and adjusted fetchJsonFile.test.js accordingly. All tests pass.
